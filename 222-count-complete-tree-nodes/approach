here we can also use different approach apart from Queue i.e normal iterative approach
class Solution {
public:
    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root == NULL) {
            return 0;
        }
        return 1 + countNodes(root->left) + countNodes(root->right);
    }
};

this iterative approach has 0 runtime and memory is 31.3MB which is less than Queue approach that also uses 0 rutime but memory is 32MB
